# Software Cost Estimation using SEERA Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on software cost estimation using the SEERA dataset. Software cost estimation is a crucial aspect of project management, and accurate estimations contribute to the successful execution of software development projects. The SEERA dataset is utilized for training various regression models to predict software development costs.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Processing:**
   - The dataset is analyzed to understand its structure and variables.
   - Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values and outliers.
   - Descriptive statistics are used to gain insights into the data.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Relevant features are selected to build an optimized model.
   - Techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and recursive feature elimination are employed.

3. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - This division allows the model to be trained on one subset and evaluated on another, ensuring generalization.

4. **Model Fitting:**
   - Four regression models are implemented:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regression
     - Gradient Boosting Regression
     - XGBoost Regression

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Various evaluation metrics such as R-squared score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error are computed to assess the performance of each model.

6. **Best Model:**
   - XGBoost Regression is identified as the best-performing model.
   - It has demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and is chosen for software cost estimation.
